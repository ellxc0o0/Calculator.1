This is my fist time making a calculator and is fully based on a toturial in youtube by LeMaster Tech. https://youtu.be/jkS4Vx85I-A?si=Q_ujCTzJiOgBTwDR
And its purpose is to only see my progress throughout my journey as a 1st year student.
That would help me in identifying further skills which I should improve in becoming a better coder and hopefully a programmer.
